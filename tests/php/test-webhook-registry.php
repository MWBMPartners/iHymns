/**
 * iHymns — Webhook event-registry coverage guard (#1909)
 *
 * ELI5
 * ----
 * Two things must always be true about webhook events: (1) every event we EMIT
 * somewhere in the code is a real, registered event type — never a typo the
 * registry doesn't know; and (2) every registered CONTENT event actually has at
 * least one place that emits it — never a dead entry nobody fires, UNLESS it's
 * on the small, commented `$deferredUnemitted` exception list (a type shipped
 * ahead of the mechanism that will fire it — #1135's `ingest.conflicted` is the
 * first). Plus (3) the admin page builds its event checkboxes FROM the
 * registry, never a typed list.
 *
 * WHY IT IS DERIVED, NOT A HARDCODED LIST (rule #34)
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * Both sides are read out of their own source at run time: the registry from
 * `includes/webhook_events.php`'s IHYMNS_WEBHOOK_EVENTS, the emit sites by
 * scanning every `webhookEmit*()` call in the tree. A hardcoded list here would
 * be a third copy of the registry with the exact drift problem rule #34 exists
 * to prevent. The emit-site scan bounds each call's window to the call STATEMENT
 * (up to its `;`), NOT a fixed char count: that still catches a type passed
 * inside a ternary (`… ? 'song.created' : 'song.updated'`) — which a same-line
 * scan would miss — while NOT spilling into an adjacent `logActivity('song.edit')`
 * on the next line (whose action keys look event-shaped but aren't ours). That
 * spill was this guard's own first-draft bug: it flagged correct code (the
 * rule-#34 "guard too blunt" trap), fixed here.
 *
 * Mutation-proven: emitting `webhookEmit('song.bogus', …)` fails check 1; deleting
 * the only emit site of a content type fails check 2; making the admin page type
 * its own event list fails check 3.
 *
 * Usage: php tests/php/test-webhook-registry.php
 * Exit 0 = pass, 1 = fail.
